## Self-hosted PR-Action

- If you host PR-Action with your OpenAI API key, it is between you and OpenAI. You can read their API data privacy policy here:

## PR-Action Pro ðŸ’Ž

- When using PR-Action Pro ðŸ’Ž, hosted by KhulnaSoft, we will not store any of your data, nor will we use it for training. You will also benefit from an OpenAI account with zero data retention.

- For certain clients, KhulnaSoft-hosted PR-Action Pro will use KhulnaSoftâ€™s proprietary models. If this is the case, you will be notified.

- No passive collection of Code and Pull Requestsâ€™ data â€” PR-Action will be active only when you invoke it, and it will then extract and analyze only data relevant to the executed command and queried pull request.


## PR-Action Chrome extension

- The [PR-Action Chrome extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/pr-action-chrome-extension/ephlnjeghhogofkifjloamocljapahnl) serves solely to modify the visual appearance of a GitHub PR screen. It does not transmit any user's repo or pull request code. Code is only sent for processing when a user submits a GitHub comment that activates a PR-Action tool, in accordance with the standard privacy policy of PR-Action.
